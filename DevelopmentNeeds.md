Want to get involved with the Backwoods Logger project? Start by joining the [discussion list](http://groups.google.com/group/backwoods-logger-discuss). Here are a few ideas for Logger improvements and new features:

# Art #
  * Create a Backwoods Logger logo, to use on future boards and the Google Code project page
  * Make a better splash screen/logo for the Logger's "unlock" screen
  * Design a case for the Logger Mini or Logger Classic that can be built by an online fabrication site like Ponoko

# Software #
  * Add more detailed analysis tools to the software. Rate of ascent graphs, day by day statistics comparisons, user-defined graph timescales, etc.
  * Alarm clock, stopwatch, and other general timer features
  * Improved weather forecasting logic (what's there now is very weak)
  * Different/better selection of graph timescales and graph exploration tools
  * Improved graph rendering
  * Better LCD contrast/bias controls for the Logger Classic
  * Improved snapshot functionality - tags? comments? auto-snapshots?
  * Preload the elevation profile of your expected route onto the logger before starting a trip, then compare measured altitude samples with the preloaded profile to determine where you are.

# Hardware #
  * Modify the Logger Mini board layout to make hand-assembly easier
  * Help design additional Logger variants using different display screens
  * Add a way to download the stored sample data to your PC or phone
  * Make a version of the Logger Classic that uses the higher-resolution OLED found on the Mini

# Everything Else #
  * Any cool idea that you're excited to work on!
