= Introduction =

The blsync utility is a command-line program used to transfer data from a Logger to a PC. The blsync adapter is a hardware module that plugs into the Logger's ISP port, and converts it to a 6-pin serial connector.

= USB-Serial =

Blsync communicates with the Logger using a 5V or 3.3V serial connection. You will need a USB-serial adapater such as:

 * [http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9873 Sparkfun FTDI Basic Breakout 3.3V]
 * [http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9717 Sparkfun FTDI Cable 3.3V]

The Backwoods Logger runs at 3.3V, but because the blsync adapter contains a built-in level-converter, you can use either a 5V or 3.3V USB-Serial cable. 

= Blsync Adapter =

The blsync adapter plugs into the Logger's ISP port, and converts it to a 6-pin serial connector. Only the RXD, TXD, and GND pins from the serial connector are used, and VCC, RTS#, and CTS# are not connected.

A 2N7000 or similar N-channel enhancement mode MOSFET is used to perform level conversion on the TX line. If you will always be using a 3.3V USB-serial cable, you can omit the MOSFET and connect TX directly to MISO.
