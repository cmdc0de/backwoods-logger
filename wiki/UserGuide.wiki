= Overview =
The Backwoods Logger is an ultra-light altimeter and thermometer, about the size of a Tic-Tac box and weighing about 1 ounce. It measures temperature, air pressure, and altitude (calculated from pressure) once a minute, and stores the data samples in memory for later review. The built-in screen can show current data, or graphs of data vs time for timescales from past 2 hours to past 2.5 days. Other built-in functions include calculation of daily highs and lows, rate of ascent, and estimated time of arrival at a user-defined altitude.

There are two versions of the Backwoods Logger: the Logger Classic and Logger Mini. The two versions differ in size, weight, and screen resolution, but otherwise have nearly identical features and capabilities.

The Logger is an open hardware project, based upon a Bosch BMP085 temperature / pressure sensor and an Atmel AVR ATmega328P microcontroller. This is the same microcontroller used in the popular Arduino electronics prototyping platform.

= Features =
* Temperature measurements in 0.5 degree steps, from -10F to 117.5F
 * Air pressure measurements in 0.01 in-Hg steps, from 5.9 to 36.12 in-Hg
 * Altitude (calculated from air pressure) measurements in 2 ft steps, from -1384 ft to 14999 ft
 * Can configure units in degrees C, millibars, and meters through software modification
 * Graphs of temperature, pressure, and altitude over time
 * Three graph time scales: past 2 hours, past 10 hours, past 2.5 days
 * Current rate of ascent/descent
 * Estimated time of arrival at a user-defined altitude
 * Weather forecast
 * Station pressure and pressure at sea level
 * Snapshot feature â€“ make a permanent record of date, time, altitude, temperature, and pressure at important waypoints
 * Current date and time display
 * Battery voltage indicator
 * Sound on/off control
 * 3 to 6 month battery life, depending on usage

= Power =
The Backwoods Logger is an always-on device, recording a new data measurement every minute. There is no on-off switch. The device sleeps between each sample to conserve power, and battery life is 3 to 6 months.

= Locking and Unlocking =
To prevent unwanted actions resulting from accidental button pushes, the Logger is normally locked, and all menus and screens are disabled. To unlock the Logger, hold the *PREV* and *NEXT* buttons simultaneously. 

After a period of inactivity, the Logger will automatically turn off the display and lock itself. The delay before auto-locking occurs can be configured in the *System* menu.

= Navigating Screens and Menus =
The Logger functions are organized into a list of 10 screens. You can move back and forward between screens in the list by pressing the *PREV* and *NEXT* buttons. The screen list is circular, so if you reach the end of the list, you will wrap around to the beginning.

Many screens have menus. To access a screen's menu, press *SELECT* while viewing the screen. Navigate between menu options using the *PREV* and *NEXT* buttons, or select the *Exit Menu* option to return to the screen.
